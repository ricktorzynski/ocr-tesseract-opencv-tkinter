# OCR Tesseract Tkinter
Allows upload of an image for OCR using Tesseract and deployed using Tkinter.  This uses Tkinter, a Python GUI framework based on Tcl/Tkl.   OpenCV is used to reduce noise in the image for better processing by pytesseract. Below are 3 images of a job posting taken on a Pixel 2XL phone, and reduced in size using Gimp by adjusting quality. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
For Windows 10, Tesseract must be installed - you can find installer here:
* [Tesseract Window 10 Installers](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)


### Installing and Running


You can use these images to test it - these are photos of a job posting:
